BotKube is now active for "testing" cluster :rocket:

*Using multiple instances*
If you are running multiple BotKube instances in the same channel to interact with testing, make sure to specify the cluster name when typing commands.
```
--cluster-name="testing"
```

*Manage incoming notifications*
```
@BotKube notifier [start|stop|status]
```
  - `@BotKube notifier start`
  - `@BotKube notifier stop`
  - `@BotKube notifier status`

*Notification types*
By default, BotKube will notify only about cluster errors and recommendations.
  - `@BotKube edit SourceBindings`

*Ping your cluster*
Check the status of connected Kubernetes cluster(s).
  - `@BotKube ping`

*Run kubectl commands*
You can run kubectl commands directly from Platform!
  - `@BotKube get services`
  - `@BotKube get pods`
  - `@BotKube get deployments`

To list all supported kubectl commands
  - `@BotKube commands list`

*Filters (advanced)*
You can extend BotKube functionality by writing additional filters that can check resource specs, validate some checks and add messages to the Event struct. Learn more at https://botkube.io/filters
