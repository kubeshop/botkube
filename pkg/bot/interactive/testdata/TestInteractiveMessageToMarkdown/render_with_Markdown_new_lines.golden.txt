BotKube is now active for "testing" cluster :rocket:

**Using multiple instances**
If you are running multiple BotKube instances in the same channel to interact with testing, make sure to specify the cluster name when typing commands.
```
--cluster-name="testing"
```

**Ping your cluster**
Check the status of connected Kubernetes cluster(s)
  - `@BotKube ping`

**Run kubectl commands**
You can run kubectl commands directly from Platform!
  - `@BotKube get services`
  - `@BotKube get pods`
  - `@BotKube get deployments`

To list all supported kubectl commands
  - `@BotKube commands list`

**Manage incoming notifications**
```
@BotKube notifier [start|stop|status]
```
  - `@BotKube notifier start`
  - `@BotKube notifier stop`
  - `@BotKube notifier status`

**Filters (advanced)**
You can extend BotKube functionality by writing additional filters that can check resource specs, validate some checks and add messages to the Event struct. Learn more at https://botkube.io/filters
