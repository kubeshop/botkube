Using multiple instances
If you are running multiple Botkube instances in the same channel to interact with testing, make sure to specify the cluster name when typing commands.
--cluster-name=testing


Ping your cluster
Check the status of connected Kubernetes cluster(s).
  - @Botkube ping

Manage incoming notifications
@Botkube notifier [start|stop|status]

  - @Botkube notifier start
  - @Botkube notifier stop
  - @Botkube notifier status

Notification settings for this channel
By default, Botkube will notify only about cluster errors and recommendations.
  - @Botkube edit SourceBindings

Manage automated actions
@Botkube [list|enable|disable] action [action name]

  - @Botkube list actions

Run kubectl commands (if enabled)
:warning: Botkube 0.17 and above will require a prefix (`k`, `kc`, `kubectl`) when running kubectl commands through the bot.

`@Botkube k get pods` instead of `@Botkube get pods`

You can run kubectl commands directly from Platform!
  - @Botkube kubectl get services
  - @Botkube kubectl get pods
  - @Botkube kubectl get deployments

To list all supported kubectl commands
  - @Botkube commands list

Filters (advanced)
You can extend Botkube functionality by writing additional filters that can check resource specs, validate some checks and add messages to the Event struct. Learn more at https://botkube.io/filters
