## Overview

Botkube helps you monitor your Kubernetes cluster, debug critical deployments and gives recommendations for standard practices by running checks on the Kubernetes resources. It integrates with multiple communication platforms, such as [Slack](https://slack.com), [Discord](https://discord.com/), or [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com).

You can also execute `kubectl`, `helm` and other commands on your K8s, which helps debugging an application or cluster.
