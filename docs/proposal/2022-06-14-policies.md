# Polices

Created on 2022-06-14 by Mateusz Szostok ([@mszostok](https://github.com/mszostok))

## Motivation

There is a demand in community to make the configuration more flexible in regards which notification should be collected and where to send.

### Goal

1. Route BotKube notifications to individual channels without needing to run multiple deployments.
   For example, I want to create a channel for network errors and another channel for node problems.

     - [Support communications per resource group](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/508)
     - [Support using multiple Slack channels with different configuration](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/444)
2. Send notifications to multiple sinks. Additionally, send the same notification to multiple channels within the same sink.
   For example send Pod's error events to Slack, and at the same time notify Elasticsearch of all events.

3. Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace.

     - [Define the channel at the namespace level](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/486)
4. Allow running executor for a given cluster only from a dedicated channel/user without needing to run multiple deployments.
   Currently, it's possible only if you will deploy multiple BotKube instances with different configuration.

### Non-goal

Those are not the goals of this proposal. However, we should be able to implement them later.
- [Notify groups](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/323)
- [Group error messages to thread](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/545)
- [Customizable Messages](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/434)
- [Support for default cluster and namespace on any Slack channels](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/421)

## Proposal

The `policy` name can be also change to `profile`, or `presets` or others. This also enables an option to create catalog of predefined policies that can be consumed by end-users.

1. New configuration syntax.
    ```yaml
    # Channels configuration
    communications:
      # Settings for Slack
      slack:
        token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
        notiftype: short
        # customized notifications
        policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
          - channel: dev
            policies: development
          - channel: prod
            # allows configuring multiple policies for the same channel,
            # so you can reuse some of them
            policies:
              - production
              - admin
          - channel: admin
            policies: admin
    ```
2. New policy syntax. It has refined notification and executors properties.
    ```yaml
    policies:
      - name: development
        executors:
          kubectl:
            namespaces
              include:
                - ns1
                - ns2
            commands:
              verbs: ["get", "logs"]
              resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
      - name: network-errors
        notifications:
          kubernetes:
            namespace:
              include: ["@all"]
            resources:
              - name: v1/pods
                namespaces: # override top level namespace
                  include:
                    - istio-system
                events:
                  - error
              - name: v1/services
                events:
                  - error
              - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/DestinationRules
                events:
                  - error
              - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/VirtualServices
                events:
                  - error
    ```

### Route BotKube notifications to individual channels

**Communicators**

```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    # customized notifications
    policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
      - channel: nodes
        policies: nodes-errors
      - channel: network
        policies: network-errors
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: nodes-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        resources:
          - name: v1/nodes
            namespaces:
              include:
                - @all
            events:
              - error
  - name: network-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespace:
          include: ["@all"]
        resources:
          - name: v1/pods
            namespaces: # override top level namespace
              include:
                - istio-system
            events:
              - error
          - name: v1/services
            events:
              - error
          - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/DestinationRules
            events:
              - error
          - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/VirtualServices
            events:
              - error
```

### Send notifications to multiple sinks

With presented configuration you:
- Send to Slack communicator:
  - Nodes events to the **nodes** channel
  - network and Nodes errors to the *all** channel _(showcase multiple polices)_
- and at the same time send to ES _(showcase mirroring to multiple sinks)_

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
      - channel: nodes
        policies: [nodes-errors, kubectl-full-access] # policies are merged together
      - channel: all
        policies: # policies are merged together
          - network-errors
          - nodes-errors
          - kubectl-full-access
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
    server: 'ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS'
    username: 'ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME'
    password: 'ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD'
    policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
      - index:
          name: network-errors
          type: botkube-event
          shards: 1
          replicas: 0
        policies: network-errors # the kubectl property is ignored for elasticsearch
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: nodes-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        resources:
          - name: v1/nodes
            namespaces:
              include:
                - @all
            events:
              - error
  - name: network-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespaces:
          include:
            - @all
        resources:
          - name: v1/services
            events:
              - error
          - name: networking.k8s.io/v1/ingresses
            events:
              - error
  - name: kubectl-full-access
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - @all
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "...", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
```

### Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace

Currently, you can send notification to non-default channel using [annotation](https://www.botkube.io/usage/#send-notification-to-non-default-channel).
However, you need to apply `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` to each K8s object (Pods, Services, etc.) which is cumbersome.

With presented configuration you can do that via the `policyBinding` property.

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding:
      - channel: dev-team-a
        policies: team-a
      - channel: dev-team-b
        policies: team-b
      - channel: admin
        policies: admin
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: team-a
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - team-a
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-a
        resources:
          - name: v1/pods
            events:
              - create
              - delete
              - error

  - name: team-b
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - team-b
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-b
        resources:
          - name: v1/pods
            events:
              - create
              - delete
              - error
```

### Running executor only from a dedicated channel

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding:
      - channel: dev
        policies: kubectl-full-access
      - channel: team-a
        # team-a channel is able to run kubectl only against 'team-a' Namespace
        policies: kubectl-team-a-ns-access
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: kubectl-full-access
    executors:
      kubectl:
        enabled: true
        namespaces:
          - @all
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
  - name: kubectl-team-a-ns-access
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - team-a
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
```

### Others

If you use the `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` annotation, notifications are sent to a given channel even if not authorized. IMO, it's a bug.
We can now check if there is a matching communications.{name}.policyBinding.{channel} and if policy allows to send such events based on `policies.[.name == foo].notifications`.

## Alternatives

Other approaches that I consider with explanation why I ruled them out.

  <summary>Discarded alternative</summary>


### Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace

#### Annotate Namespace

Allow to set the `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` on the Kubernetes Namespace object. As a result, all object's notification from annotated Namespace will be sent to a given channel. Such approach solves the problem partially. You don't need to annotate each object manually in a given Namespace. However, it's still not a part of the BotKube installation. You need to do that manually, or automate that in some way. Additionally, it's decoupled from the BotKube configuration causing that there are multiple source of true which you need to analyze to understand to which Namespace the notification will be sent.

#### Top level Namespace property

In the proposed solution, the **namespace** property is defined separately for **executors.kubectl** and **notifications.resources**. In the future it can be added to other executors, e.g. **executors.helm**. This approach provides fine-grained configuration. You can specify allowed namespace independently, so you can watch for events in all Namespaces but allow `kubectl` usage only in `dev` Namespace.

Unfortunately it doesn't come without any cost. If you want to have a strict policy that Team A can access only the `team-a` Namespace, you need to configure that for each executor and notificator. It may be error-prone.

To solve that we can extract the **namespace** property to top level. In this case it will be common for all executors and notificators:

```yaml
policies:
  # based on use-case like profile for development environment
  - name: development
    namespaces:
    include:
      - team-b
      - kube-system
    executors:
      kubectl:
        enabled: true
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      resources:
        - name: v1/pods
          events:
            - create
            - delete
            - error
```

The other option is to extract it even higher. In that way the policies will become a generic description that can be attached to a given platform **channel** with a given **Namespace**:

```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding:
      - channel: team-b
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-b
        policies: example-policy
      - channel: team-a
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-a
        policies: example-policy
```
```yaml
policies:
  - name: example-policy
    executors:
      kubectl:
        enabled: true
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      resources:
        - name: v1/pods
          events:
            - create
            - delete
            - error
```
