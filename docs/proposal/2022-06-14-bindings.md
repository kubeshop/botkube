## Motivation

There is a demand in community to make the configuration more flexible in regards which notification should be collected and where to send.
This proposal also address the configuration design issues.

### Goal

1. Route BotKube notifications to individual channels without needing to run multiple deployments.
   For example, I want to create a channel for network errors and another channel for node problems.
   Related issues:
     - [Support communications per resource group](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/508)
     - [Support using multiple Slack channels with different configuration](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/444)
2. Send notifications to multiple sinks. Additionally, send the same notification to multiple channels within the same sink.
   For example send Pod's error events to Slack, and at the same time notify Elasticsearch of all events.

     - [Provide multiple channels](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/542)
3. Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace.
   Related issues:
     - [Define the channel at the namespace level](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/486)
4. Allow running executor for a given cluster only from a dedicated channel/user without needing to run multiple deployments.
   Currently, it's possible only if you will deploy multiple BotKube instances with different configuration.

### Non-goal

Those are not the goals of this proposal. However, we should be able to implement them later.
- [Notify groups](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/323)
- [Group error messages to thread](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/545)
- [Customizable Messages](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/434)
- [Support for default cluster and namespace on any Slack channels](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube/issues/421)

## Proposal

This idea is to explicitly extract such configuration domains:
- Executors, such as `kubectl`, `helm`, `istioctl` etc.
- Notifiers, such as Kubernetes events, Sysdig, Prometheus, etc.
- Communications, such as Slack, Discord, MS Teams etc.

1. New communications syntax.
    ```yaml
    communications: # allows to have multiple slacks, or ES configurations
      - name: tenant-workspace
        slack:
          token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
          # customized notifications
          channels:
            - name: "#nodes"
              bindings:
                notifiers:
                  - "nodes-errors"
                  - "depreacted-api"
                executors:
                  - "kubectl-read-only"
                  - "helm-full-access"
        elasticsearch:
          enabled: true
          server: 'ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS'
          username: 'ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME'
          password: 'ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD'
          index:
            - destination:
                name: network-errors
                type: botkube-event
                shards: 1
                replicas: 0
              bindings:
                notifiers:
                  - "nodes-errors"
                  - "depreacted-api"
                # executors - not allowed in this case, ES is "sink" only.
    ```

2. New executor syntax.
     ```yaml
    executors:
      - name: kubectl-read-only # name used for bindings
        kubectl:
          namespaces:
            include:
              - team-a
          commands:
            verbs: ["api-resources", "...", "auth"]
            resources: ["deployments", "..", "nodes"]
      - name: helm-full-access # name used for bindings
        helm:
          namespaces:
            include:
              - team-a
          commands:
            verbs: ["list", "delete", "install"]
    ```

3. New sources syntax.

     ```yaml
     notifiers:
       - name: nodes-errors # name used for bindings
         kubernetes:
           resources:
             - name: v1/nodes
               namespaces:
                 include:
                   - all
               events:
                 - error
         sysdig:
           # ..
         kubePug:
           # ...
     ```

### Route BotKube notifications to individual channels

**Communicators**

```yaml
communications: # allows to have multiple slacks, or ES configurations
  - name: tenant-workspace
    slack:
      token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
      # customized notifications
      channels:
        - name: "#nodes"
          bindings:
            notifiers:
              - "nodes-errors"
        - name: "#network"
          bindings:
            notifiers:
              - "network-errors"
```

**Notifiers**

```yaml
notifiers:
 - name: nodes-errors # name used for bindings
   kubernetes:
     resources:
       - name: v1/nodes
         namespaces:
           include:
             - @all
         events:
           - error
  - name: network-errors
    kubernetes:
      namespace:
        include: ["@all"]
      resources:
        - name: v1/pods
          namespaces: # override top level namespace
            include:
              - istio-system
          events:
            - error
        - name: v1/services
          events:
            - error
        - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/DestinationRules
          events:
            - error
        - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/VirtualServices
          events:
            - error
```

### Send notifications to multiple sinks

With presented configuration you:
- Send to Slack communicator:
  - Nodes events to the **nodes** channel
  - network and Nodes errors to the *all** channel _(showcase multiple polices)_
- and at the same time send to ES _(showcase mirroring to multiple sinks)_

**Communicators**

```yaml
communications: # allows to have multiple slacks, or ES configurations
  - name: tenant-workspace
    slack:
      token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
      # customized notifications
      channels:
        - name: "#nodes"
          bindings:
            notifiers:
              - "nodes-errors"
            executors:
              - "kubectl-full-access"
        - name: "#all"
          bindings:
            notifiers:
              - network-errors
              - nodes-errors
            executors:
              - kubectl-full-access
    elasticsearch:
      enabled: true
      server: 'ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS'
      username: 'ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME'
      password: 'ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD'
      index:
        - destination:
            name: network-errors
            type: botkube-event
            shards: 1
            replicas: 0
          bindings:
            notifiers:
              - network-errors
```

**Notifiers**
```yaml
notifiers:
  - name: nodes-errors
    kubernetes:
      resources:
        - name: v1/nodes
          namespaces:
            include:
              - @all
          events:
            - error
  - name: network-errors
    kubernetes:
      namespaces:
        include:
          - @all
      resources:
        - name: v1/services
          events:
            - error
        - name: networking.k8s.io/v1/ingresses
          events:
            - error
```

**Executors**
```yaml
executors:
  - name: kubectl-full-access
    kubectl:
      namespaces:
        - @all
      commands:
        verbs: ["get", "...", "logs"]
        resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
```

### Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace

Currently, you can send notification to non-default channel using [annotation](https://www.botkube.io/usage/#send-notification-to-non-default-channel).
However, you need to apply `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` to each K8s object (Pods, Services, etc.) which is cumbersome.

With presented configuration you can do that via the `policyBinding` property.

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications: # allows to have multiple slacks, or ES configurations
  - name: tenant-workspace
  slack:
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    # customized notifications
    channels:
      - name: "#dev-team-a"
        bindings:
          notifiers:
            - "team-a"
          executors:
            - "team-a"
      - name: "#dev-team-b"
        bindings:
          notifiers:
            - "team-b"
          executors:
            - "team-b"
      - name: "#admin"
        bindings:
          notifiers:
            - "team-a"
            - "team-b"
          executors:
            - "team-a"
            - "team-b"
```

**Notifiers**
```yaml
notifiers:
  - name: team-a
    kubernetes:
      namespaces:
        include:
          - team-a
      resources:
        - name: v1/pods
          events:
            - create
            - delete
            - error

  - name: team-b
    kubernetes:
      namespaces:
        include:
          - team-b
      resources:
        - name: v1/pods
          events:
            - create
            - delete
            - error
```

**Executors**
```yaml
executors:
  - name: team-a
    kubectl:
      namespaces:
        - team-a
      commands:
        verbs: ["get", "logs"]
        resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
  - name: team-b
    kubectl:
      namespaces:
        - team-b
      commands:
        verbs: ["get", "logs"]
        resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
```

### Running executor only from a dedicated channel

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications: # allows to have multiple slacks, or ES configurations
  - name: tenant-workspace
  slack:
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    # customized notifications
    channels:
      - name: "#dev-team-a"
        bindings:
          executors:
            - "kubectl-team-a-ns-access"
      - name: "#admin"
        bindings:
          executors:
            - "kubectl-full-access"
```

**Executors**
```yaml
executors:
  - name: kubectl-full-access
    kubectl:
      enabled: true
      namespaces:
        - @all
      commands:
        verbs: ["get", "logs"]
        resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
  - name: kubectl-team-a-ns-access
    kubectl:
      namespaces:
        - team-a
      commands:
        verbs: ["get", "logs"]
        resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
```

### Others

If you use the `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` annotation, notifications are sent to a given channel even if not authorized.
With a new syntax, we can check if there is a matching notifier binding for a given channel.

## Alternatives

Other approaches that I consider with explanation why I ruled them out.

<details>
  <summary>Discarded alternative</summary>


### Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace

#### Annotate Namespace

Allow to set the `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` on the Kubernetes Namespace object. As a result, all object's notification from annotated Namespace will be sent to a given channel. Such approach solves the problem partially. You don't need to annotate each object manually in a given Namespace. However, it's still not a part of the BotKube installation. You need to do that manually, or automate that in some way. Additionally, it's decoupled from the BotKube configuration causing that there are multiple source of true which you need to analyze to understand to which Namespace the notification will be sent.

#### Top level Namespace property

In the proposed solution, the **namespace** property is defined separately for executors and notifiers. This approach provides fine-grained configuration. You can specify allowed namespace independently, so you can watch for events in all Namespaces but allow `kubectl` usage only in `dev` Namespace.

Unfortunately it doesn't come without any cost. If you want to have a strict dedicated bindings for Team A can access only the `team-a` Namespace, you need to configure that for each executor and notificator. It may be error-prone.
To solve that we can extract the **namespace** property to top level. In this case it will be common for all bindings:

```yaml
communications: # allows to have multiple slacks, or ES configurations
  - name: tenant-workspace
    slack:
      token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
      # customized notifications
      channels:
        - name: "#nodes"
          namespace:
            include: ["team-a"]
          bindings:
            notifiers:
              - "nodes-errors"
            executors:
              - "kubectl-read-only"
              - "helm-full-access"

executors:
  - name: kubectl-read-only
    kubectl:
      commands:
        verbs: ["api-resources", "...", "auth"]
        resources: ["deployments", "..", "nodes"]
  - name: helm-full-access
    helm:
      commands:
        verbs: ["list", "delete", "install"]

notifiers:
  - name: nodes-errors
   kubernetes:
     resources:
       - name: v1/nodes
         events:
           - error
```

</details>

## Consequences

This section described necessary changes if proposal will be accepted.

### Minimum changes

1. The `resources` notifications are moved under `notifiers[].kubernetes[].resources`.
2. Kubectl executor moved under `executors[].kubectl`.
3. The `namespaces.include` and `namespaces.exclude` properties are added to the `kubectl` executor.
3. The `namespaces.include` and `namespaces.exclude` properties are added to `notifiers[].kubernetes[]`.
4. The `resource_config.yaml` and `comm_config.yaml` are merged into one, but you can provide config multiple times. In the same way, as Helm takes the `values.yaml` file. It's up to the user how it will be split.
5. Update documentation about configuration.

### Follow-up changes

1. Recommendations are merged under notifications.
2. Filters are removed and existing one are moved under `notifications[].recommendations[]`.
3. Update `@BotKube` commands to reflect new configuration.
4. **Optional**: Add CLI to simplify creating/updating configuration.
