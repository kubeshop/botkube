# Polices

Created on 2022-06-14 by Mateusz Szostok ([@mszostok](https://github.com/mszostok))

This is the alternative solution to address both the configuration design issues and multichannel support. It was replaced by the [Bindings](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/pull/626) proposal.

## Syntax

This section describes changes in the configuration syntax. As a result, we enable routing notifications to individual channels and limiting channel access to a specific Namespace. **Syntax is not backward compatible.**

1. New configuration syntax.
    ```yaml
    # Channels configuration
    communications:
      # Settings for Slack
      slack:
        token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
        notiftype: short
        # customized notifications
        policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
          - channel: dev
            policies: development
          - channel: prod
            # allows configuring multiple policies for the same channel,
            # so you can reuse some of them
            policies:
              - production
              - admin
          - channel: admin
            policies: admin
    ```
2. New policy syntax. It has refined notification and executors properties.
    ```yaml
    policies:
      - name: development
        executors:
          kubectl:
            namespaces
              include:
                - ns1
                - ns2
            commands:
              verbs: ["get", "logs"]
              resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
      - name: network-errors
        notifications:
          kubernetes:
            namespace:
              include: ["@all"]
            resources:
              - name: v1/pods
                namespaces: # override top level namespace
                  include:
                    - istio-system
                events:
                  - error
              - name: v1/services
                events:
                  - error
              - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/DestinationRules
                events:
                  - error
              - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/VirtualServices
                events:
                  - error
    ```
The `policy` name can be also changed to `profile`, or `preset` or others. Later, we can  create catalog of predefined policies that can be consumed by end-users.

## Use cases

This section describes example configurations that enable the requested use-cases.

### Route BotKube notifications to individual channels

**Communicators**

```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    # customized notifications
    policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
      - channel: nodes
        policies: nodes-errors
      - channel: network
        policies: network-errors
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: nodes-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        resources:
          - name: v1/nodes
            namespaces:
              include:
                - @all
            events:
              - error
  - name: network-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespace:
          include: ["@all"]
        resources:
          - name: v1/pods
            namespaces: # override top level namespace
              include:
                - istio-system
            events:
              - error
          - name: v1/services
            events:
              - error
          - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/DestinationRules
            events:
              - error
          - name: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3/VirtualServices
            events:
              - error
```

### Send notifications to multiple sinks

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
      - channel: nodes
        policies: [nodes-errors, kubectl-full-access] # policies are merged together
      - channel: all
        policies: # policies are merged together
          - network-errors
          - nodes-errors
          - kubectl-full-access
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
    server: 'ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS'
    username: 'ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME'
    password: 'ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD'
    policyBinding: # overrides the default configuration
      - index:
          name: network-errors
          type: botkube-event
          shards: 1
          replicas: 0
        policies: network-errors # the kubectl property is ignored for elasticsearch
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: nodes-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        resources:
          - name: v1/nodes
            namespaces:
              include:
                - @all
            events:
              - error
  - name: network-errors
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespaces:
          include:
            - @all
        resources:
          - name: v1/services
            events:
              - error
          - name: networking.k8s.io/v1/ingresses
            events:
              - error
  - name: kubectl-full-access
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - @all
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "...", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
```

### Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace

Currently, you can send notification to non-default channel using [annotation](https://www.botkube.io/usage/#send-notification-to-non-default-channel).
However, you need to apply `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` to each K8s object (Pods, Services, etc.) which is cumbersome.

With presented configuration you can do that via the `policyBinding` property.

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding:
      - channel: dev-team-a
        policies: team-a
      - channel: dev-team-b
        policies: team-b
      - channel: admin
        policies: admin
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: team-a
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - team-a
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-a
        resources:
          - name: v1/pods
            events:
              - create
              - delete
              - error

  - name: team-b
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - team-b
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      kubernetes:
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-b
        resources:
          - name: v1/pods
            events:
              - create
              - delete
              - error
```

### Running executor only from a dedicated channel

**Communicators**
```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding:
      - channel: dev
        policies: kubectl-full-access
      - channel: team-a
        # team-a channel is able to run kubectl only against 'team-a' Namespace
        policies: kubectl-team-a-ns-access
```

**Policies**
```yaml
policies:
  - name: kubectl-full-access
    executors:
      kubectl:
        enabled: true
        namespaces:
          - @all
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
  - name: kubectl-team-a-ns-access
    executors:
      kubectl:
        namespaces:
          - team-a
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
```

### Others

If you use the `botkube.io/channel: <channel_name>` annotation, notifications are sent to a given channel even if not authorized. IMO, it's a bug.
We can now check if there is a matching `communications.{name}.policyBinding.{channel}` and if policy allows to send such events based on `policies.[.name == foo].notifications`.

## Alternatives

Other approaches that I consider with explanation why I ruled them out.

  <summary>Discarded alternative</summary>


### Route notifications to a given channel based on the Kubernetes Namespace

#### Top level Namespace property

In the proposed solution, the **namespace** property is defined separately for **executors.kubectl** and **notifications.resources**. In the future it can be added to other executors, e.g. **executors.helm**. This approach provides fine-grained configuration. You can specify allowed namespace independently, so you can watch for events in all Namespaces but allow `kubectl` usage only in `dev` Namespace.

Unfortunately it doesn't come without any cost. If you want to have a strict policy that Team A can access only the `team-a` Namespace, you need to configure that for each executor and notificator. It may be error-prone.

To solve that we can extract the **namespace** property to top level. In this case it will be common for all executors and notificators:

```yaml
policies:
  # based on use-case like profile for development environment
  - name: development
    namespaces:
    include:
      - team-b
      - kube-system
    executors:
      kubectl:
        enabled: true
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      resources:
        - name: v1/pods
          events:
            - create
            - delete
            - error
```

The other option is to extract it even higher. In that way the policies will become a generic description that can be attached to a given platform **channel** with a given **Namespace**:

```yaml
communications:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    token: 'SLACK_API_TOKEN'
    policyBinding:
      - channel: team-b
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-b
        policies: example-policy
      - channel: team-a
        namespaces:
          include:
            - team-a
        policies: example-policy
```
```yaml
policies:
  - name: example-policy
    executors:
      kubectl:
        enabled: true
        commands:
          verbs: ["get", "logs"]
          resources: ["Deployments", "Pods", "Services"]
    notifications:
      resources:
        - name: v1/pods
          events:
            - create
            - delete
            - error
```
